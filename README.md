# 🔎Overview

Aila is a fully customizable Discord Bot, meaning that all features can be enabled/disable as you wish, adapting it to your needs.  
My wish is to keep this bot hosted on proprietary servers, to make the experience more enjoyable and not put pressure on you, but if you want you can *self-host* your own instance and maintain it.


# 📖Documentation

Docs are currently being written, I'll be honest, it's the first time for me to publish an open-source project so pls have mercy.✨ 

# 🌐Web-Dashboard

This is the next level-up for the bot i want to implement, create a web-dashboard online to allow anyone from everywhere to modify their own bot settings. Maybe while sitting on the sofa eating chips.
